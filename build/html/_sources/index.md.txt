# Introduction 

Shape-CE workflow intend to provide automation in the data treatment of SHAPE Capillary Electrophorese.

It relies on : 

- QuShape
- IPANEMAP
- RNAFold
- VARNA. 
- Custom scripts for file conversion, reactivity normalization and aggregation.

The workflow will enable you to generate structure data for a RNA fragment analysed using SHAPE with a arbitrary set of conditions (Temperature, Magnesium, Probes.)

# Introduction 

RNAsique workflow intend to provide automation in the data treatment of SHAPE Capillary Electrophorese.

It relies on : 

- QuShape
- IPANEMAP
- RNAFold
- VARNA. 
- Custom scripts for file conversion, reactivity normalization and aggregation.

The workflow will enable you to generate structure data for a RNA fragment analysed using SHAPE with a arbitrary set of conditions (Temperature, Magnesium, Probes.)

The workflow is available at [https://github.com/Sargueil-CiTCoM/rnasique](https://github.com/Sargueil-CiTCoM/rnasique).

The source code for this documentation is available at [https://github.com/SargueilCiTCoM/shape-ce-docs](https://github.com/Sargueil-CiTCoM/shape-ce-docs)
